### Network Troubleshooting
- Methodology
  - Identify the problem
    - Gather information
    - Identify symptoms
    - Question users
    - Change management logs
    - Duplicate the problem
    - Multiple problems?
  - Establish a theory of cause
    - Refer to the OSI model. Start at the bottom, top or middle. Whichever makes the most sense based on the symptoms.
      - 7 Application Layer
      - 6 Presentation Layer
      - 5 Session Layer
      - 4 Transport Layer
      - 3 Network Layer
      - 2 Data Link Layer
      - 1 Physical Layer
  - Test the theory
    - Avoid breaking network
    - Escalate, if your theory does not work.
  - Establish a plan of action
    - Assuming you've identified the problem, the theory of cause appears accurate and the test of the theory went well, create a plan of action.
    - Examine the required changes. Consider effects across the network.
    - Use the formal change management process for implementing the change.
    - Create a rollback plan.
  - Implement a solution
  - Verify solution
    - Ask the user if they're now able to perform the task.
  - Document solution
  - If, after iterating through this methodology, the problem hasn't been solved, start over.
- CLI Utilities: Packet Internet Groper (Ping), ARP, and Route.
  - Test if a device is online and able to respond to ICMP
  - `ping <ip-address>`
  - Show the routing table:
  - `ip r` 
  - Display the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache:
  - `arp -a`
  - Traceroute: show the routers the traffic passes through on the way to destination.
  - `traceroute <ip-address-or-domain-name>`
  - Investigate sockets:
  - `ss`
