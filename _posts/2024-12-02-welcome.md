Welcome to my technical blog! I'm Xavier Lopez, a Senior Platform Engineer with over 10 years of experience in DevOps, cloud architecture, and platform development. Also, I'm just gonna come clean and tell you that my friends Claude and ChatGPT are heavily involved in this effort. We're using this as an opportunity to get to know each other.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to share insights and learnings from my journey in platform engineering, including:

- DevOps best practices and patterns
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- AWS architecture and cloud infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline optimization
- Security and compliance in cloud environments
- Platform engineering philosophy

## Recent Work

I've recently been focused on:

- Migrating build processes to AWS Image Builder (achieving 87% improvement in build times)
- Implementing rootless container builds with Buildah
- Expanding platform support for multiple technology stacks
- Modernizing security tooling with SBOM-based scanning

Stay tuned for more detailed technical posts about these topics and more!
