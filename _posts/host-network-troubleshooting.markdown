### Host Network Troubleshooting
- Check name resolution  
  - `cat /etc/nsswitch.conf`
  - `getent hosts`
  - `dig`
  - `resolvectl`
- Interface information
  - What's thej name of the interface we're using?  
  - `ip a s`
  - Are we dropping packets?  
  - `ip -s link show <iface-name>`
  - Look at the raw information:  
  - `cat /proc/net/dev`
  - Look at the same file, with columns:  
  - `column -t /proc/net/dev`
  - View configured options of the NIC, to see it's maximum bandwidth and speed capability, in order to compare it to the actual performance:  
  - `ethtool <interface-name>`
  - View current bandwidth and NIC speed:  
  - `nload <interface-name>`
- Test network access and network configuration issues
  - Automate ping of default gateway
  - `ping $(/sbin/ip route show | awk '/default/ { print $3 }')`
  - Check subnet mask to be sure it's the same as all the other hosts on the network.
  - `ip -4 addr show`
  - `ip -4 route`
  - Port scanning: check to see if port 22 is open on localhost
  - `nmap -p 22 localhost`
  - Check to see if port 22 is open on a range of hosts.
  - `nmap -p 22 192.168.1.11-13`
- Firewalls
- Enable firewall
  - `sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld`
- List firewall rules
  - `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all`
