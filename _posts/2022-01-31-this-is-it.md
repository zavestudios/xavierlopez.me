Hello there. This is the first post of the new zavestudios. You have no idea how many times this idea has false started. This time, though, is for real. First off, this site will be eponymous. I decided not to use the domain name 'zavestudios' for this. I'm using that name elsewhere, for now. 

Also, I need to give a shout out to Fabian Lee.  I love his blog, and I'm shamelessly borrowing from his.  I'm not sponging content from him, mind you, just his layout and his way of organizing material.  Would you like to know which of his posts is my favorite?  This one right here.
